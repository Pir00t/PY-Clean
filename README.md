# PY-Clean

**Python 3**

_Hacked together Windows Directory Cleaner_

The script takes valid directories as input, recursively searches for files and does a hash comparison. Duplicates are then flagged to the user with the option to Delete or skip. All matches are recorded in log.txt.

The script is by no means perfect but does what I required from it. 

It also provides a good example of code reuse as outlined in my [blog](https://ultimacybr.co.uk/)
